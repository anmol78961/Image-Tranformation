# Image Tranformation Lab

## Compound Transform
Run the program “rotate2D”. This shows rotation of a blue square about the red point. Changing the point makes the square rotate at the new point.

## Articulated Motion
Run the program “earthmoon”, which shows a square moon (in black) orbiting a square earth (in blue), a second moon (in red) that orbits the earth, and a third moon that orbits the second moon (in yellow), instead of the earth.

## Estimating Transformations
Run the program “transforms”, which transforms a shape (a black ‘F’) in various ways, using Isotropic scaling, Anisotropic scaling, traslation & rotation.
